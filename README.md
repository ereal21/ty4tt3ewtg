## Installation ðŸ’¾
[QUICK START](markdown/quick_start.md)

For local testing of NOWPayments webhooks you need to run the IPN server and expose it with **ngrok**:

```bash
python ipn.py
# in another terminal
ngrok http 5000
```

Use the HTTPS URL as `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL` in your environment so NOWPayments can

reach your webhook endpoint. Include the `/nowpayments-ipn` path, e.g.:

```
NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL=https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app/nowpayments-ipn
```
=======
reach your webhook endpoint.

Create a `.env` file with all required keys (see `markdown/quick_start.md`) and then run the bot:

```bash
python run.py
```
