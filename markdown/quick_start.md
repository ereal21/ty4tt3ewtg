     - `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_SECRET` - secret used to verify IPN callbacks
     - `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL` - public URL for NOWPayments webhooks (set via ngrok during development). Include `/nowpayments-ipn` in the URL.


   5. [Setup config.py](../bot/misc/config.py)
      - CHANNEL_URL - telegram channel link (to disable, set `CHANNEL_URL: Final = 'https://t.me/'`)
      - HELPER_URL -  telegram username for help (to disable, set `HELPER_URL: Final = None`)
      - [GROUP_ID](https://docs.b2core.b2broker.com/how-to-articles/manage-communication-platforms/how-to-get-telegram-chat-group-and-channel-identifiers) -  telegram group ID (to disable, set `GROUP_ID: Final = None`)

   6. If you plan to receive IPN webhooks, start the IPN server and expose it with ngrok:
       ```bash
       python ipn.py
       # in another terminal
       ngrok http 5000
       ```
      Use the HTTPS URL shown in the console as `NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL`, e.g.:

      ```
      NOWPAYMENTS_IPN_URL=https://xxxx.ngrok-free.app/nowpayments-ipn
      ```
  7. Run run.py
   8. Make sure your self-hosted nodes are up and RPC endpoints match the URLs above.

### P.S.
1. Add the bot to the channel and group you have provided and make it an admin
2. To apply latest migration, use 
      ```
      alembic upgrade head
      ```
